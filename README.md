# Crafting Interpreters

This is the repo for my exercises/follow-through of the book "Crafting Interpreters", a book about compilers. Please also keep in mind that I'm also using this book to get more hands on experience with Rust, so my code might not be very good yet.

In order to use the code, clone this repository, make sure you have rust and cargo installed and run:

```
cargo run
```

This will prompt a simple CLI that accepts text and tries to interpret it. For now it doesn't do much, only tries to figure out the tokens it can grab from the text. (Not fully functional yet, will update README.md as soon as it is)
